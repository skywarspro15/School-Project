  Some politicians don't give enough attention to these issues.

  Today's gender issues are not being given enough attention by politicians.
  Many people believe that this lack of attention is due to the fact that
  politicians are more concerned with their own careers than with addressing the
  gender issues facing society today. <br />
  <br />
  Some politicians have tried to address the gender issues facing society. For
  example, in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has instituted a number of
  policies to support women. For example, he has appointed a cabinet that is
  about 50% women, and he has made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of
  gender. <br />
  <br />
  However, many politicians have ignored today's gender issues. For example, in
  the United States, President Trump has attacked a number of women. He mocked
  Carly Fiorina's appearance, and he attacked Megyn Kelly for asking him
  questions about his treatment of women. <br /><br />
  Overall, politicians need to take more action to address today's gender
  issues.
