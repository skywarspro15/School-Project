<p class="subtitle">
  Start promoting gender equality instead of posting offensive posts.

<br />
<p class="subtitle">
  In order to promote gender equality on social media, people should stop making
  jokes about gender, post comments that discriminate against women, and other
  forms of discrimination. People should also report discriminatory comments to
  the social media service. <br />
  <br />
  Additionally, use social media to educate others about gender equality. Post
  information about gender equality issues, such as equal pay for equal work,
  sexual harassment, or gender discrimination. <br />
  <br />
  Finally, use social media to find other women who are interested in promoting
  gender equality. Form groups or communities on social media that are
  interested in gender equality.
