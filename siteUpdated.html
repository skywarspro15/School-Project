<p class="subtitle">Welcome to our new, and updated site!</p>
<br />
<p class="subtitle">
  We now have a new project: Gender Issues <br />
  This project focuses on tackling about gender issues and how we could mitigate
  it. <br />
  <br />
  Here's the things that's changed for a technical standpoint: <br />
  <br />
  - More fluent design <br />
  From buttons to modals, we have refreshed the design of the page. <br />
  <br />
  - Improved performance <br />
  This new version of the site is more faster than the last version, improving
  UX. <br />
