<p class="title">Gender issues in the social media</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Social media opens doors for people to interact to one another, and this opens
  up issues.
</p>

<p class="subtitle">
  Social media is revolutionizing the way we interact, and this is not without
  consequences. <br />
  <br />
  The anonymity and intimacy that social media provides allows users to say and
  do things that they would not dare say or do in person. <br />
  <br />
  Unfortunately, this lack of face-to-face interaction can cause problems,
  particularly in the area of gender relations. Many men use social media to
  make sexist or misogynist comments. <br />
  <br />
  These comments can be hurtful to women who read them, and they can also have a
  negative effect on the man who makes them. By engaging in this behavior, men
  demonstrate that they do not respect women, and this can lead to women not
  feeling safe on social media. <br />
  <br />
  Social media can also have a positive effect on gender relations. Some people
  use social media to promote gender equality. They post messages in support of
  feminism, and they encourage other men to respect women.
