<p class="subtitle">Recruiters judge people based on their gender.</p>
<br />
<p class="subtitle">
  Most recruiters only consider gender when making hiring decisions. They do
  this because they are afraid to admit they are prejudiced against a certain
  gender. <br /><br />
  For example, if a company is only hiring men, the recruiter will claim that
  there are no qualified women for the position. <br />
  <br />
  Some recruiters even admit that they are less likely to hire women than men.
  They claim that women aren't as ambitious or driven as men. <br /><br />
  However, this is simply not true. There are plenty of successful female
  executives, managers, and business owners. Recruiters need to quit considering
  gender when making hiring decisions. Instead, they should focus on a
  candidate's skills and experience.
